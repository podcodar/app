Name the branch with your first name pre-pended and after the bar `/`, write a [semantic term](https://programadriano.medium.com/dica-r%C3%A1pida-commits-sem%C3%A2nticos-e0ca2139badd#:~:text=Chore%3A%20Utilizamos%20o%20chore%20quando,como%3A%20adicionar%20algo%20dentro%20do%20.) to describe your modifications: \
 `git checkout -b name/feat-my-feature`.

### 3 - Commit your changes.

Always do [semantics commits](https://programadriano.medium.com/dica-r%C3%A1pida-commits-sem%C3%A2nticos-e0ca2139badd#:~:text=Chore%3A%20Utilizamos%20o%20chore%20quando,como%3A%20adicionar%20algo%20dentro%20do%20.):

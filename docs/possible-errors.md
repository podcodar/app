## Possible errors

1 - One possible error happens when the prisma client hasn't been generated. Normally shows this:

_Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet. Please run "prisma generate" and try to import it again.
In case this error is unexpected for you, please report it in https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues_

To fix this you can use:
`npx prisma generate`

or if you are using yarn:
`yarn prisma generate`

2 - You can see the localhost but nothing happens from there.

Make sure that you are using docker.

Open docker and then try to run the project again.

3 - Version Conflicts

Often, different tools and libraries have specific version requirements. If these versions are not compatible with each other, you may face conflicts resulting in errors.

4 - Operating System Compatibility Issues

Depending on the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux), you may encounter specific issues related to permissions, file paths, or different system requirements. It is recommended to use a Unix-based system (such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, or any other) or MacOS. Windows may encounter certain issues with Docker.

5 - CTypeScript Configuration

Configuration errors in TypeScript, such as mismatched settings in the `tsconfig.json` file, can occur and cause issues during code compilation.

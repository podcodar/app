To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

Using npm:
`npm run dev`

Using yarn:
`yarn dev`

If you encounter any issues or errors during this step, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

1.  Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
    Make sure you've already run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install project dependencies.
    If not, run `npm install` or `yarn install` before running the `dev` command.

2.  Check Node.js and NPM/Yarn Versions:
    Ensure that you have a compatible version of Node.js installed. You can check your Node.js version by running:
    `node -v`
    Additionally, verify your npm or yarn versions:
    `npm -v` or `yarn -v`

3.  Verify Configuration:
    Ensure that your project's configuration files (e.g., 'package.json') are correctly set up, including any scripts necessary for development.

4.  Resolve Dependency Conflicts:
    If there are dependency conflicts, resolve them based on the error messages provided. You might need to update or remove conflicting packages.

5.  Check for Environment Variables:
    Some projects require environment variables to be set. Check the project documentation for any specific environment variables you need to configure.

If you've addressed these potential issues and still encounter problems, feel free to seek assistance in the project's community or support channels.

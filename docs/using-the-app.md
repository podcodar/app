# Using the app

Before we proceed, please make sure there were no issues with the installation. If you are having any problems, please contact one of the tech leaders.:bulb:

To start the development server, run the following command:

`pnpm dev`

It's a walk in the park. :grin::leaves: Now, for make sure that is working, try to open the link: [http://localhost:3000][1]

:arrow_right: If you encounter any issues or errors during this step, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

1. Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
   Make sure you've already run `pnpm install` to install project dependencies.
   If not, run this command before running the `pnpm dev`.

2. Verify Configuration:
   Ensure that your project's configuration files (e.g., 'package.json') are correctly set up, including any scripts necessary for development.

3. Resolve Dependency Conflicts:
   If there are dependency conflicts, resolve them based on the error messages provided. You might need to update or remove conflicting packages.

4. Check for Environment Variables:
   Some projects require environment variables to be set. Check the project documentation for any specific environment variables you need to configure.

:arrow_right: If you've addressed these potential issues and still encounter problems, feel free to seek assistance in the project's community or support channels. :wink:
